## About

The project base is forked from [MetaMask/Nextjs-Starter](https://github.com/MetaMask/Nextjs-Starter)

This dApp is a prototype that is intended to illustrate the approach of blockchain technology in the area of classic ERP systems. It represents a business use case from human resource management.

Technologies used are:
- [Truffle Suite](https://trufflesuite.com/) are tools for smart contract development. (I use Truffle and Ganache)
- [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/) is a programming language for smart contracts.
- [Web3.js](https://web3js.org/#/) is a JavaScript library for building on Ethereum.
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) is a modern React framework.
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) is a crypto wallet and gateway to dApps as a browser extension.

## Get started

1. Checkout this repository.
2. Switch in the project folder and run `npm install`
3. Run `truffle compile` to build production ready files for the blockchain.
4. Get [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) for your system.
5. Host a local ethereum blockchain with Ganache for experimenting. (Use port 7545 or edit truffle-config.js!)
6. Deploy the smart contracts to blockchain with `truffle deploy`.
7. Run `npm run dev` and open in your browser [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
8. Get [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) for your browser.
9. Connect MetaMask to your local blockchain.
10. Import accounts into MetaMask from your local blockchain.
11. Have fun with the dApp!
